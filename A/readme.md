# Magical Energy – Alternating Sequence Problem

In the land of Elaria, a mage casts a spell producing an alternating energy wave
sequence: x, -x, x, -x, ... for n waves.

This program calculates the total magical energy after all n waves.

## Logic
- If n is even → total energy = 0  
- If n is odd → total energy = x  

## To run file
- Java should be installed in the system
- use javac to compile file
- use java to run class file

```
// Compile .java file to .class file
javac TaskA.java
// run .class file
java TaskA
```
